There's a popular JAMMA-compatible arcade PCB of questionable legality called
Pandora's Box which allows the player to enjoy 500+ classic arcade games on one
cabinet. It does this by bundling MAME, a custom Qt frontend, and a bunch of
ROMs on a single-board computer powered by the Allwinner A13 ARM-based chip.

This is just a simple tool that breaks the 'encryption' that they use on their
graphical assets and executable files.
